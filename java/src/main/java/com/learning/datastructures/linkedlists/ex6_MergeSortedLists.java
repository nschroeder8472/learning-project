/**
 * Exercise: Merge Two Sorted Lists (Hard)
 *
 * Given the heads of two sorted linked lists, merge them into one sorted linked list.
 * The merged list should be made by splicing together the nodes of the two lists.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: list1 = 1 -> 3 -> 5 -> null, list2 = 2 -> 4 -> 6 -> null
 * Output: 1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 5 -> 6 -> null
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: list1 = null, list2 = 1 -> 2 -> null
 * Output: 1 -> 2 -> null
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n + m) where n and m are the lengths of the two lists
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - only using pointers, no new nodes created
