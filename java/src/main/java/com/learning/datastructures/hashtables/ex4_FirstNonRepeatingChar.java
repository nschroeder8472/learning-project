/**
 * Exercise: First Non-Repeating Character (Medium)
 *
 * Given a string s, find the first non-repeating character in it and return its index.
 * If it does not exist, return -1.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: s = "leetcode"
 * Output: 0
 * Explanation: 'l' is the first character that does not repeat
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: s = "loveleetcode"
 * Output: 2
 * Explanation: 'v' is the first non-repeating character
 *
 * Example 3:
 * Input: s = "aabb"
 * Output: -1
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(1) - at most 26 lowercase English letters
