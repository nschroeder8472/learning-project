/**
 * Exercise: Two Sum (Easy)
 *
 * Given an array of integers nums and an integer target, return indices of the
 * two numbers such that they add up to target.
 *
 * You may assume that each input would have exactly one solution, and you may
 * not use the same element twice.
 *
 * Example:
 * Input: nums = [2, 7, 11, 15], target = 9
 * Output: [0, 1]
 * Explanation: nums[0] + nums[1] == 9, so return [0, 1]
 *
 * Example 2:
 * Input: nums = [3, 2, 4], target = 6
 * Output: [1, 2]
 *
 * Time Complexity: O(n)
 * Space Complexity: O(n)
